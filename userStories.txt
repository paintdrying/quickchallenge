# Clinton Electronics Coding Challenge
Hello John, congrats on making it to the next step: the Coding Challenge! This challenge consists of a real-world mini project which will give us a chance to evaluate your coding abilities. We anticipate this challenge will take 6-8 hours to complete and is due by 5pm on Wednesday 8/28. When you are finished, please commit your code to a GitHub repository and email us the link.

Good Luck!

# Front End Coding Test

This challenge features a common piece of any web application - the User Account management form. We're looking for a web page which allows a user to edit and update their user account information. Our application is written in React, but you may complete this challenge using pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
Here are the requirements:

- Provide a UI epresenting a "User Account" page.
- Display the user's properties on the page.
- Provide a form to allow the user to edit their properties.
	- Users should not be able to edit their id.
- Include some validation on the form, which must validate before they are allowed to save their changes.
	- All fields are required.
	- Email must be in a valid format.
	- Users must be at least 18 years old.
	
- Provide a "Save Changes" button which calls a fake API endpoint.
	- Make an HTTP 'PUT' request to a fake API endpoint with PostBin, Hookbin, or something similar.
	- The Content-Type of this request should be 'application/json'.
	- The body of the request should be the updated user object.
	- Make the request using the fetch api and async/await keywords.
- You may use any other libraries/modules you wish.
- While these are the only 'Requirements', we will be looking at overall front-end skills, so feel free to show us what you've got.
